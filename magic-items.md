# UNCOMMON ITEMS

| Item | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Boots of Elvenkind** | Wonderous, uncommon | While you wear these boots, your steps make no sound, regardless of the surface you are moving across. You also have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks that rely on moving silently. |
| **Cloak of Billowing** | Wonderous, common | While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to make it billow dramatically. |
| **Cloak of Many Fashions** | Wonderous, common | While wearing this cloak, you can use a bonus action to change the style, color, and apparent quality of the garment. The cloak's weight doesn't change. Regardless of its appearance, the cloak can't be anything but a cloak. Although it can duplicate the appearance of other magic cloaks, it doesn't gain their magical properties. |
| **Clockwork Amulet** | Wonderous, common | This copper amulet contains tiny interlocking gears and is powered by magic from Mechanus, a plane of clockwork predictability. A creature that puts an ear to the amulet can hear faint ticking and whirring noises coming from within. When you make an attack roll while wearing the amulet, you can forgo rolling the d20 to get a 10 on the die. Once used, this property can't be used again until the next dawn. |
| **Dragon Slayer** | Weapon (any sword), rare | You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit a dragon with this weapon, the dragon takes an extra 3d6 damage of the weapon's type. For the purpose of this weapon, "dragon" refers to any creature with the dragon type. |
| **Dread Helm** | Wonderous, common | This fearsome steel helm makes your eyes glow red while you wear it. |
| **Dust of Disappearance** | Wonderous, uncommon | Found in a small packet, this powder resembles very fine sand. There is enough of it for one use. When you use an action to throw the dust into the air, you and each creature and object within 10 feet of you become invisible for 2d4 minutes. The duration is the same for all subjects, and the dust is consumed when its magic takes effect. If a creature affected by the dust attacks or casts a spell, the invisibility ends for that creature. |
